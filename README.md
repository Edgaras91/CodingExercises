# PaymentGateway
API solution on ASP.NET Core 3.1

Project showcases inheritance, asynchronous line by line data reads, reflection, data annotations, data logging and NUnit tests.

This is my first ever attempt to create an api from scratch, which gave me numerious obstacles and cost me alot of time, for which I could have procduced more code instead.

I suggest starting the application from the tests.
